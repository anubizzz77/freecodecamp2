            <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Dr. Julius Hibbert life:</h3>
</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
<li><strong>1933</strong> - Dr. Hibbert is married; He and his wife Bernice have at least three unidentified children, two boys and a girl.</li>
<li><strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li>
<li><strong>1937</strong> - a genius (with an IQ of 155), a member of Mensa, a graduate student at Johns Hopkins University of Medicine, and a corporate fellow at Johns Hopkins Hospital.</li>
<li><strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li>
<li><strong>1941</strong> - He also often gives dubious solutions to medical problems. For example, when Maggie saved Homer from drowning, he attributed it to one of the common cases of human supernatural strength in children whose parents are in grave danger.</li>
<li><strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
<li><strong>1944</strong> - outstanding doctor in all of Springfield, although he usually does not show effort or commitment in his work</li>
<li><strong>1945</strong> - One of its main characteristics is to laugh in the least opportune situations. </li>
<li><strong>1953</strong> - Saved children from Syria and Africa and also created cures for multiple diseases.</li>
<li><strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population</li>
<li><strong>1970</strong> - He does not legally practice medicine, although in other episodes he often contradicts himself.</li>
<li><strong>1983</strong> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields</li>
<li><strong>1984 - He is a Harvard Distinguished Professor.</strong></li>
<li><strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
<li><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95</li>
</ul>
